# 0x02. i18n

"i18n" stands for internationalization. It is a commonly used abbreviation in software development and refers to the process of designing and developing software applications that can be easily adapted and localized for different languages, regions, and cultures. The term "i18n" is derived from the word "internationalization" by replacing the 18 letters between the first 'i' and the last 'n' with the number '18'. The number represents the number of omitted letters.

Internationalization involves designing software in a way that separates the user interface and language-specific content from the core application logic. This allows for the easy translation and adaptation of the software to different languages and locales without requiring major code changes.
